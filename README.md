## ![](/icons/icon_conceito.png) About the Project

I created a candy store website using HTML and CSS. The homepage features a banner with the store name and a navigation bar with links to the different sections of the website.

The "About" section provides information about the store's history and mission. The "Products" section displays images and descriptions of the different types of candies available, sorted into categories such as chocolate, gummies, and sour candies.

The "Contact" section includes a form for customers to fill out if they have any questions or feedback. The footer includes links to the store's social media pages and a copyright notice.

Throughout the website, I used a bright and colorful design to convey the fun and playful atmosphere of a candy store. I also used responsive design techniques to ensure that the website looks good on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to smartphones.
